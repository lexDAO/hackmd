# Proposal
On the 
1. basis of the "[First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder) Responder Protocol" [^1] and on the recognition that 
2. I was a ␢DAO contributor under eaglelex ~2-3 years ago (I wrote a brief on crypto law in AU/NZ); and 
3. in the _prolonged absence_ of _any_ response within LG ... (I've been checking the LegalGuild meeting weekly);

I wish to submit a private proposal[^2] to **disband the LegalGuild** and outsource functions to LexDAO [^5] on either (casemix funding): 
- a contingency basis ... ␢DAO [^3] lodges tlBANK into LexDAO for emergency response to legal situation;
- for a fixed rate of $BANK to LXCHAT [^6] (we don't have an economic token, LXCHAT is equiv to 15min consultation with a paralegal we provide as many hours as you deem fit to your ombuds office);
- we have a formal _upskilling exchange_ ([timebanked](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/time-banking.asp#:~:text=Understanding%20Time%20Banking,regardless%20of%20the%20service%20rendered.)) where you send Dev or PM over and we force-feed them legal information up to Lvl1+ or Lvl2- (I'll spec out the skills later).

The should basically give all your business development path operators a basic paralegal-level understanding of the law (broadly defined but initially limited to [NAFTA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nafta.asp)) as applied to crypto and basic contract/tort/equity but globally upon ascension to DUNA status[^7]. The goal is _not to teach lawyers_, but to graft recognition of when to run to the ombudsman and get legal expert opinion. We've (putting on my LexDAO hat) got lawyers, legal engineers, and l'experts on tap to satisfy the full spectrum of needs rather than uncompensated sparsely staffed volunteers.
