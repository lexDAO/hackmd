# Proposal - Clinic management of Creative Commons NFT working group

**Created Date**: 2023-06-11
**Sponsor**: bestape (Kyle Smith)
**Budget**: $5,000 USD
**Project Duration**: 6 Months 

## Executive Summary
### Project Introduction 

LexDAO successfully received a grant from Creative Commons to work on an NFT project. In that grant, bestape stated that LexClinic will be managing the grant on behalf of LexDAO. 

The Creative Commons grant is for $5,000. Creative Commons has already sent the first $2,500 to LexDAOâ€™s bank account.

This proposal requests that: 

1. LexDAO immediately sends $2,500 worth of USDC, DAI or ETH to LexClinic at https://app.kali.gg/daos/1/0x5c48ffb7e69d2b17d99eafaa4a3ea811ee43da08 .

2. At project completion, after Creative Commons sends the remaining $2,500 to LexDAO, LexDAO sends $2,500 worth of USDC, DAI or ETH to LexClinic at https://app.kali.gg/daos/1/0x5c48ffb7e69d2b17d99eafaa4a3ea811ee43da08 .

The following is a reproduction of the proposal Creative Commons approved.

## Activity Title

CC licenses for NFTs

## Description of the Activity

CC licenses, especially CC0, are very popular for NFT projects. However, it is unclear whether CC licenses are appropriate for NFT projects. As such, organizations such as A16Z and IC3 have created their own NFT licenses. These A16Z and IC3 licenses are based on CC licenses, but are optimized for the USA jurisdiction and could encourage counterproductive licence standards fractionalization among other concerns from a CC goals and principles perspective. We propose a CC working group that will: 1) research and report on how the NFT specific A16Z and IC3 licenses differ from CC licenses, as well as licenses from other providers if they exist; and 2) research, report and make recommendations about whether CC licenses are sufficient as-is for NFTs. 

Once approved, will round up other collaborators. Including those from Hardcore Cryptolawyer, LexDAO and other web3 legal expert communities we are active within. Kyle runs the Clinic in LexDAO, and this is an excellent opportunity for our law students! We'll also reach out to our friends at Ethereum Catherders and Ethereum Magicians, which are the organizations that issue NFT standards such as ERC721 and 1155. See https://doc.lex.clinic/job/open-a-file/role

Of course we hope other CC members join this project, in addition to the web3 public good and NFT experts we plan to source.

## measurable outcomes for this activity

Two reports: 1) CC licenses compared to A16Z and IC3 NFT licenses; and 2) how sufficient CC licenses are for NFT projects.

One recommendation: 1) how to better accommodate NFTs with CC licenses, if at all.
